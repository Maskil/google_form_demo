# How to use it
## #1 Step: Setup Python. 
- ### Install Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Make sure the Python version is above **3.8**
- ### Open cmd or Terminal and type `pip` or `pip3`. If either of them exist, install necessary Python Modules by typing beginning with `pip` or `pip3`. Make sure to move to a new line after typing each line.<br/>
```
    (pip or pip3) install beautifulsoup4
    (pip or pip3) install lxml
    (pip or pip3) install selenium
```
## #2 Step: Setup chromedriver
- ### Install Chrome from [here](https://www.google.com/chrome/?brand=CHBD&brand=SZLF&gclid=Cj0KCQiA7NKBBhDBARIsAHbXCB6VQeMaSJShxbmZNnXguG7wwkxQgbd_ZItio2ECsqL4e46A0NwwX7AaAmb4EALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds). In Chrome, go to `Settings -> About Chrome` and check the Chrome version *(Ex: 88)*. 
- ### Install chromedriver from [here](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads). Make sure to download the chromedriver accordingly to your Chrome version. Since the program requires the location of the chromedriver, please be aware where the chromedriver is.
## #3 Step: Run the script
- ### Note: There are various ways to run a Python script. The method below is just an example.
- ### Open `formfiller.py` by `IDLE`. Noting that `IDLE` is a basic IDE automatically installed while installing Python. The script of the `formfiller.py` should be readable.
- ### Press F5 from the keyboard button to run the script.
### After successfully running the script, there will be a few more instructions inside the program. If you meet any issue not listed in [FAQ](#faq), please contact the author by [email](#about-the-author) so the problem can be fixed ASAP.<br/><br/>

# FAQ
## Q: I messed up with the first three steps!
- ### A: Use Google.
## Q: I'm using Windows and the chromedriver location does not work!
- ### A: For Windows, you need to put `.exe` at the end of the chromedriver file. For instance, `C:\user\Downloads\chromedriver\chromedriver.exe`<br/>For Mac or Linux, `.formatname` is not required.<br/><br/>
